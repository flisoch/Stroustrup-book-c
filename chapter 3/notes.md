## switch-case doesn't work with strings
`==` with `if` works well with strings, I don't know why it can't compare strings in switch-case.
So use primitives working with switch-case, or use solutions that can give you similar to switch-case interface/api, or compare in switch-case another types like `int` hash(string) or smth with `map`s.
