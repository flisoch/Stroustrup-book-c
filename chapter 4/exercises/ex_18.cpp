//
// 18. Write a program to solve quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0
// If you donâ€™t know the quadratic formula for solving such an expression, do some research. Remember,
// researching how to solve a problem is often necessary before a programmer can teach the computer how to solve it.
// Use doubles for the user inputs for a, b, and c. Since there are two solutions to a quadratic equation,
// output both x1 and x2.
//
// 1 -1 -2 outputs x1=2, x2=-1 which is right
