1. What is a computation?

Computation is transforming inputs into outputs! in our case numbers to another numbers

2. What do we mean by inputs and outputs to a computation? Give examples.

Give me your birth date/year and current year and I'll compute your current age. Birth date and current year are inputs and your current age is output

3. What are the three requirements a programmer should keep in mind when expressing computations?

Correctness - program must give results which fulfill our needs. No matter how fast or simple it is if it doesn't solve the problem.

Simplicity - every program will evolve if it's going to live, so the program should be easy to modify, rewrite, add new functionality

Efficiency - when it doesn't confront first 2 requirements, we should express computations so that they are as efficient as possible
(considering resources available and other constraints). 2 rules of improving performance: 1 - don't do it. 2 - don't do it unless you.. really need it(?) or understand process very well(?) 

4. What does an expression do?

They represent computations, variables which values will be used in computations, processes to store some values in some objects/variable. So expressions are small bricks that are conceptually bond with computations - says expression thinks about computation

5. What is the difference between a statement and an expression, as described in this chapter?

6. What is an lvalue? List the operators that require an lvalue. Why do these operators, and not the others, require an lvalue?

7. What is a constant expression?

8. What is a literal?

9. What is a symbolic constant and why do we use them?

10. What is a magic constant? Give examples.

11. What are some operators that we can use for integers and floating-point values?

12. What operators can be used on integers but not on floating-point numbers?

13. What are some operators that can be used for strings?

14. When would a programmer prefer a switch-statement to an if-statement?

15. What are some common problems with switch-statements?

16. What is the function of each part of the header line in a for-loop, and in what sequence are they executed?

17. When should the for-loop be used and when should the while-loop be used?

18. How do you print the numeric value of a char?

19. Describe what the line char foo(int x) means in a function definition.

20. When should you define a separate function for part of a program? List reasons.

21. What can you do to an int that you cannot do to a string?

22. What can you do to a string that you cannot do to an int?

23. What is the index of the third element of a vector?

24. How do you write a for-loop that prints every element of a vector?

25. What does vector<char> alphabet(26); do?

26. Describe what push_back() does to a vector.

27. What does vectorâ€™s member size() do?

28. What makes vector so popular/useful?

29. How do you sort the elements of a vector?
