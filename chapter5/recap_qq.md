1. Name four major types of errors and briefly define each one.

- Syntax error

    language things, statements, expressions must follow language rules
- Linktime error
    
    every function has to be declared and there should be implementation of this function somewhere among files that will be compiled and linked together
- Runtime error

    If your code is compiled successfully, there can still be runtime errors like out_of_range or bad cast an etc. 
- Logic error
    
    This is when your code compiles, linkes, doesn't throw any exception, gives you/computes for you some results, but they are wrong. And you have to program so that this errors in computation are less likely to occur or at least they are easy to find. You can make pre- and post-conditions in functions to indicate logical errors.
